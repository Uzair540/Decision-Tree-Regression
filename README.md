# Decision-Tree-Regression
## Implementing Machine Learning Algorithm : Decision Tree Regression on the data-set of Salaries of Employees Based on their Positions
I will be solving the same problem about predicting salary of a new employee based on his position level.Decision tree regression model is Non Linear and a Non continuous model
### Project Objective
Let’s assume the above table is what the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee. For our project, let’s take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. So based on the table above — he falls between level 6 and level 7 — Lets say he falls under level 6.5
We want to build a model to predict what salary we should offer this new employee.
Let’s get started
